A reverse engineering challenge written for the CyberSCI 2024 Nationals competition.

## Challenge Background Story

At the CSides 2024 conference, attendees are in for a treat with the addition of a luxurious bar. As part of the experience, each participant receives a small program containing a free-drink ticket. However, there's a twist: the ticket is encrypted with a message rumored to contain the conference organizer's innermost desires. Can you crack the encryption to claim your complimentary drink and uncover the secrets of the organizer's secret wishes?

## Instructions

The binary `freedrink` is heavily obfuscated and requires a username and password for access. Your goal is to uncover both the username and password to retrieve the flag, formatted as `flag{...}`. While traditional methods are an option, feel free to explore alternative approaches to extract the flag.
